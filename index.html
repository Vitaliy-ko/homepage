                  <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been
                    more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful
                    like me. Romney &mdash; I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters,
                    but my IQ is one of the highest &mdash; and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or

                      is very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana
